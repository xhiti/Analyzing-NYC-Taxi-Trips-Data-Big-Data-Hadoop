# Analyzing-NYC-Taxi-Trips-Data-Big-Data-Hadoop
Big Data &amp; Hadoop (Sandbox) #Linux

**Big Data & Hadoop: 
- Introduction to Big Data and Hadoop. 
  We will learn about Hadoop and its architecture. How to install hadoop and how to manage it with commands. We will understand the 
  difference between different versions of Hadoop and how hadoop uses ETL.
  
**Hive: 
- We will understand what types of problems Hive solves in Big Data. We will use different 
  data models, get acquainted with the different types of files that Hive has and use data management 
  in Hive via of the query.
  
**Pig:
- We will understand how Pig solves problems in Big Data. mode of operation, differences 
  between Pig and SQL.

**Use Cases: 
- Real-time applications to better understand Hadoop and its components, so we will 
  learn how to build a simple Data Pipeline in Hadoop to process big data.
